## Lägenhetsbyte - Front-End Challenge

Build a simple list application according to specification w/ attached design screenshot. Think through your implementation. Bonus points for documented thoughts on your workflow/process.

Questions are allowed – Robert is your contact: [073-507 22 92](tel:+46735072292) or [robert@lagenhetsbyte.se](mailto:robert@lagenhetsbyte.se).

**A few notes on the assignment:**

- No back-end code is expected – mock the data however you like.
- Use version control (Git preferably); and commit frequently.
- Use no frameworks or libraries at all, only pure HTML, CSS & JS.
- **Write code as if it was to be delivered to production.**

_1) I'm not talking about minification and such, but rather code that you can feel proud of [for a while at least](http://explosm.net/comics/3433/)._

## The Assignment

1. Replicate the design, in the screenshot, below as a web application.
2. Make it possible to add new items to the list.
  1. Tags for each item are created with `#hashtags`
  2. Tag names are assigned a unique color when created
3. Tags above the list filter the list for items with that tag.
4. Document, or implement, any enhancements you can think of.
5. (Tags are always sorted alphabetically [A–Z].)

_2) And reused for that tag name in all other items. (Example: #important [red], #todo [orange], #important [red])_

_3) This is completely free-form, it can be anything related to the interface, interaction, code or whatever you can think of._

## Completion and Follow-Up

When you're done, send us the project together with your notes ([robert@lagenhetsbyte.se](mailto:robert@lagenhetsbyte.se)).

We'll review the application, and potentially book a follow-up interview (remote or not) in which we'll talk about the different aspects of the challenge and discuss it; e.g:

- Code design choices that were made and their [dis]advantages.
- Usability, accessibility, and the application's interaction.
- Your additional notes on the challenge.
