## Lägenhetsbyte - Front-End Challenge

Build a simple list application according to specification w/ attached design screenshot. Think through your implementation. Bonus points for documented thoughts on your workflow/process.

Questions are allowed – Robert is your contact: [073-507 22 92](tel:+46735072292) or [robert@lagenhetsbyte.se](mailto:robert@lagenhetsbyte.se).

**A few notes on the assignment:**

- No back-end code is expected – mock the data however you like.
- Use version control (Git preferably); and commit frequently.
- Use no frameworks or libraries at all, only pure HTML, CSS & JS.
- **Write code as if it was to be delivered to production¹.**

_1) I'm not talking about minification and such, but rather code that you can feel proud of [for a while at least](http://explosm.net/comics/3433/)._

## The Assignment

1. Replicate the design, in the screenshot, below as a web application.
2. Make it possible to add new items to the list.
  1. Tags for each item are created with `#hashtags`
  2. Tag names are assigned a unique color when created²
3. Tags above the list filter the list for items with that tag
4. Document, or implement, any enhancements you can think of³.
5. (Tags are always sorted alphabetically [A–Z].)

_2) And reused for that tag name in all other items. (Example: #important [red], #todo [orange], #important [red])_

_3) This is completely free-form, it can be anything related to the interface, interaction, code or whatever you can think of._

## Completion and Follow-Up

When you're done. Send us the project together with your notes ([teddy@lagenhetsbyte.se](mailto:teddy@lagenhetsbyte.se)).

We'll review the application, and potentially book a follow-up interview (remote or not) in which we'll talk about the different aspects of the challenge and discuss it; e.g:

- code design choices that were made and their [dis]advantages.
- usability, accessibility, and the application's interaction.
- your additional notes on the challenge.
