## Lägenhetsbyte - Back-end Challenge

Build a simple console application that reports the current weather for a provided city.

Questions are allowed – Robert is your contact: [073-507 22 92](tel:+46735072292) or [robert@lagenhetsbyte.se](mailto:robert@lagenhetsbyte.se).

**A few notes on the assignment:**

- Use version control (Git preferably), and commit frequently.
- Write your code as if it was to be deployed in production.
- A reasonable time frame for the task is 2-5 hours but the most important part is that you are satisfied with the result—don't stress!

## The Assignment

The application should behave similarly to the following example:

Input:
```txt
> weather stockholm
```

Example output:
```txt
Weather: 1C, Cloudy
Humidity: 85%
Wind: 3 m/s
```

- Use modern technologies
- You are expected to grab the weather data from a RESTful API
- Frameworks are allowed (e.g. for object serialization)
- Writing unit tests and documentation is encouraged
- You may report the weather as you like, the above output is just an example

## Completion and Follow-Up

When you're done, send us a link to your repository (e.g. GitHub) along with your notes and thoughts on the assignment to [robert@lagenhetsbyte.se](mailto:robert@lagenhetsbyte.se).

We'll review the application, and potentially book a follow-up meeting in which we'll discuss the different aspects of the challenge, e.g:

- Code quality and readability
- Design choices that were made and their [dis]advantages
- Your additional notes on the task
